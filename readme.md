# Analysis

## Dashboard 1: Ride Stations by Usage

Has a banner along the top with a quick summary showing: top/bottom 10 Start Stations: Avg Trip Duration, Distance & Total Trips. 
We can see that the average trip duration for the top 10 start stations is almost half that of the bottom 10 start stations, whereas the distance travelled is only slightly shorter. The number of trips taken at the top 10 start stations is of course much higher than that of the bottom 10 stations.   

Next, we have 3 bar charts showing: top 10 most popular start & end stations, the bottom 10 start stations and the bottom 10 end stations. Each bar chart shows the name of the station & the number of trips that have started/ended there.
The top 10 start stations are the same as the top 10 end stations. This could make sense because if most people are ending their journeys at these stations, the bikes would be left there and this would leave them as popular starting stations for the next people that ride those bikes. 

One possible explanation for the top 10 start stations having a shorter average trip time could be due to faulty bikes – users would start their journey with them, then end the trip and pick up another bike and take that to the end of their journey. Another reason could be that users are only taking the bikes for shorter journeys near those bike stations. 

However, the least popular start stations were not the same as the least popular end stations. Only 1 trip was ended at the bottom 10 end stations. These stations are located further away from the rest of the bike stations, which could mean just a few irregular users used these bikes for one off trips. 
	
## Dashboard 2: Monthly changes from Jan – Aug 2022

This dashboard has 4 figures: % user growth over the months, monthly changes I avg trip durations, peak start times & changes in annual members vs casual users. 

The first chart shows the percentage growth in the number of users over the months. We can see that the number of users has increased every month. The greatest increase in rides was from February to March (62%). 

The next graph on the right shows the changes in trip durations over the months – these go up and down, and May had the highest avg trip durations, whilst July had the lowest. 

The peak journey start times for the summer & winter months were very similar – a lot of journeys start at 8am, but the most journeys start at 5 & 6pm. This would coincide with when people finish work, during the rush hour. It is possible that people would prefer riding a bike from work to home, rather than to work in the morning (possibly to avoid being sweaty at work!). 

Finally, the final bar chart shows the changes in riders (broken down by annual subscribers & casual members) each month. During each month, the number of members are higher than the number of casual riders. Each month, the number of users of the bikes increase. 

## Map 

The map shows the start and end stations, along with the station ID and the zip code. The end stations are marked in blue with square marks, whereas the end stations are marked in orange with circle markers. We can see from the map that the popular stations have bigger markers, and they are closer together. The stations that are the furthest away are not used much, with some stations only having 1 ride ended there.
